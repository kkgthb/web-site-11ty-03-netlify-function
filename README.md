Here's some boilerplate so you can focus on building Netlify Functions.

1. Build a Netlify site out of this codebase.
2. Go to `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/` -- there should be static content visible on the home page.
	* [Example home page](https://11ty-netlify-function-hello.netlify.app/)
3. Go to `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/helloWorld` -- it should greet you with "Hello World."
	* [Example hello world function](https://11ty-netlify-function-hello.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/helloWorld)
4. Go to `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/helloWorld?name=FirstName` -- it should greet you with "Hello FirstName."
	* [Example hello world function with parameter](https://11ty-netlify-function-hello.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/helloWorld?name=Katie)
5. Experiment with actually writing functions -- have fun.
